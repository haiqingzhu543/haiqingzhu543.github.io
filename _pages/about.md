I am Haiqing Zhu, a second year PhD student in computer science of the [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/), supervised by [Prof. Lexing Xie](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~xlx/) and [Dr. Yun Kuen Cheung](https://comp-math-econ.academy/index_.html#). My research interest lies in the field of theoretical computer science, specifically in the area of algorithmic game theory and optimisation.
